                    <p class="about-text">Tacos Don Cuco started back in May of 2018. It is a family owned business that was started by Jonathan and Don Cuco. We take pride in our customer service and love making everyone feel like family when they stop by and eat. The craft of our taco starts with a handmade tortilla topped with your choice of meat that’s cooked on 100% mesquite, which gives it the unique flavor. Tijuana Style tacos have a very distinct flavor and a smell that can be smelled a mile away. The dream continues for us. We want to be able to keep our culture alive one taco at a time by sharing it with the world. If 
                        you would like to know more about us please feel free to reach out or check us out on Instagram or better yet visit one of our 3 locations near you.
